# Description
### Why was this project significant?
Every full stack developer starts somewhere; For many learners in the Fullstack Flex course, their coding and development journey started with Module 1. The lessons taught in Module 1 centered on basics of Git, Visual Studio, HTML, and CSS, to provide students with a powerful foundation to continue fostering their knowledge of developement and code. Challenges at the end of each module are comprehensive practical tests of what we've learned so far. These Challenges provide opportunity for students to display and practice what they've learned so far, identifying their strengths and weaknesses along the way. Furthermore, these Challenges encourage students to think about code in "real-world" applications, which is an unequivocally benefical skill to foster before entering the workforce.  

### What did this project ask of us? 
The Module 1 challenge was a code refactoring assignment based on what we've learned in Module 1. Students were presented with a User Story: A marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that their site may be optimized for search engines. The basic code for the homepage was privded, and we were tasked with ensuring that: HTML semantics were easy to identify, heading attributes fell in sequential order, title elements were clear and concise, all image elements have alt attributes, and that HTML and CSS elements followed a logical and structure as much as possible. We were asked to keep the website's design as close as we could to the original. 

Additionally, part of this challenge was working with Git, making sure students were using Git to commit changes from their local machine, back to Github.
